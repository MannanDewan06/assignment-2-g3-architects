              Scale refers to a building's size in relation to its surroundings
              and other objects, including the human body. If you are in a room
              right now, think about how high the ceilings are related to your
              size. What about the doorway you went through to enter the room?
              When looking at a building from the outside, scale takes into
              consideration how large other structures are in comparison. You
              also want to think about any landscaping and how that relates to
              the building as a whole. Proportion is a little bit different than
              scale and describes the relationship between the different parts
              of an object. When thinking about a building's proportion,
              consider how the parts relate to the whole.

          <h2 class="font65 bold font">What Is Architecture?</h2>
          <p>
            Architecture is the craft of planning, designing, and constructing
            buildings and other physical structures. While the profession of the
            architect has taken on new definition and prestige in the last few
            centuries, we humans have been incorporating distinctive design
            elements into our structures for thousands of years.
          </p>
          <h2 class="font45 bold">Popular Styles of Home Architecture</h2>
          <p>
            The following are major examples of domestic architectural styles
            frequently seen today. Some of them have emerged relatively
            recently, while others are revivals of older forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tudor. Tudor architecture originated in England in the 1500s, shaped
            by new innovations like chimney stacks and fireplaces and the
            increasing affordability of brick. Tudor Revival architecture
            emerged in the nineteenth century, but in American homes,
            construction reached its greatest popularity in the 1970s and '80s,
            as homebuilders sought to evoke the cozy feeling of English country
            houses. Distinctive features of the Tudor style include high pitched
            roofs and gables, tall chimneys, large mullioned windows,
            herringbone brickwork, and exterior walls that are half-timbered
            with white stucco infill. Interiors often feature exposed ceiling
            beams and large fireplaces, in the spirit of a medieval mansion's
            great hall, the central chamber for entertaining guests. Country
            clubs and golf courses also frequently feature buildings in a Tudor
            style, implying a sense of Old World tradition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mediterranean Revival. Mediterranean Revival architecture borrows
            distinctive elements from Renaissance architecture of Spain and
            Italy, first brought to the Americas during the colonial period.
            These features include rectangular floor plans, white stucco walls,
            red tiled roofs, arched windows, balconies, and even bell towers
            reminiscent of Spanish churches. These structures are often
            surrounded by landscape architecture featuring lush gardens with
            tropical plants. Mediterranean Revival gained popularity in the
            1920s and '30s, as hotels in Florida and California sought to
            replicate the grandeur of European seaside villas, hoping to bring
            an impression of sophisticated luxury to their newly developing
            coastlines. In recent decades, the style became a frequent choice
            for home construction, supplanting the Tudor style in popularity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Craftsman. The Craftsman style is one of the most distinctive
            movements in American architecture. In the 1890s, a group of
            influential Boston architects and interior designers organized to
            promote its principles, drawing inspiration from Britain's Arts and
            Crafts movement. Reacting against both the Industrial Revolution and
            the overly ornate Victorian aesthetic, the Craftsman style
            emphasized visible handwork, local materials, and simplicity of
            design. Its proponents were also determined to bring beauty to
            modest homes affordable to America's growing middle class, and by
            the early 20th century the style had become extremely popular in
            cities of the western United States, whose older neighborhoods still
            feature many exquisite examples. The Craftsman style projects clean
            lines, symmetry, and sturdiness. Its distinctive features include
            low-pitched roofs, deep eaves overhanging front porches, exposed
            rafters, wide windows, and natural materials like wood and stone.
            Interiors feature low ceilings, built-in cabinets, and open floor
            plans, ideally appointed with furniture sharing the same design
            principles, like pieces by Gustav Stickley (one of the founders and
            chief advocates of the Craftsman movement). The early work of Frank
            Lloyd Wright and the “Prairie School”—the pioneering architects of
            turn-of-the-century Chicago—is closely related to the Craftsman
            style.
          </p>
          <p>
            De Stijl. De Stijl (Dutch for “The Style”) was a movement launched
            by artists and architects in the Netherlands at the end of World War
            I. Its founders believed their work could be made universal through
            pure abstraction. They simplified visual forms to the horizontal and
            vertical and utilized only black, white, and primary colors. The
            paintings of Piet Mondrian clearly demonstrate this aesthetic. The
            architects Jacobus Johannes Pieter Oud and Gerrit Rietveld
            translated the style into three-dimensional designs (in both homes
            and furniture). De Stijl buildings are identifiable by their
            intersecting rectangular shapes and use of stark white and solid
            primary colors. Interiors may feature sliding panels enabling areas
            to convert from private rooms to open spaces. Elements of De Stijl
            are still popular in architecture today, particularly in stylish
            condominiums and other multi-unit dwellings.
