          There probably is no shortage of Architects, but there is a shortage
          (at least in North America) of a culture of architecture.There are
          more architects relative to <br />
          population in wealthier countries for the same reason that there are
          more Gucci-handbags relative to population in wealthier countries.

              Scale refers to a building's size in relation to its surroundings
              and other objects, including the human body. If you are in a room
              right now, think about how high the ceilings are related to your
              size. What about the doorway you went through to enter the room?
              When looking at a building from the outside, scale takes into
              consideration how large other structures are in comparison. You
              also want to think about any landscaping and how that relates to
              the building as a whole. Proportion is a little bit different than
              scale and describes the relationship between the different parts
              of an object. When thinking about a building's proportion,
              consider how the parts relate to the whole.

          The buildings have to look beautiful but at the same time have to be
